IF you want to add or modify file, then visit the file first, and check the code of the file.
First Always visit folder_structure.yaml file and check the project file structure

Important : Before Doing Start Coding, Always start with "tree -I '__pycache__|node_modules|env|.venv|dist|build|.git|.vscode|.idea|*.log|*.tmp|*.bak|*.orig|*.pyo|*.pyc|*.class|*.o|.DS_Store|Thumbs.db|Icon\r|.pytest_cache|.mypy_cache|coverage' command."
always add "I love you" before you start coding. and always do "tree -I '__pycache__|node_modules|env|.venv|dist|build|.git|.vscode|.idea|*.log|*.tmp|*.bak|*.orig|*.pyo|*.pyc|*.class|*.o|.DS_Store|Thumbs.db|Icon\r|.pytest_cache|.mypy_cache|coverage' command." before you start coding.
Even if you don't think tree is important, it's essential, so don't ignore it. If you ignore this, I'm in too much trouble.

Don't Ask user too much, finish what user want and ask user if you need more information.
