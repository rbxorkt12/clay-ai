Let me help you with the Poetry issue. This error typically occurs when there's a problem with Python environment configuration. Let's fix this step by step:

1. First, let's check if we have any conflicting Python environments:

```bash
# Remove existing Poetry installation
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 - --uninstall

# Clear Poetry cache
rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/pypoetry
rm -rf ~/.cache/pypoetry
rm -rf ~/.local/share/pypoetry

# Reinstall Poetry with the official installer
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

2. After installation, add Poetry to your PATH if not already done:

```bash
# Add this to your ~/.zshrc or ~/.bash_profile
export PATH="/Users/$USER/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

3. Then source your profile:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc  # or source ~/.bash_profile
```

4. Verify the installation:

```bash
poetry --version
```

5. If you're still having issues, try creating a new Poetry environment:

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd /path/to/your/project

# Remove existing virtual environment if any
poetry env remove python

# Create a new virtual environment
poetry env use python3
poetry install
```

The error you're seeing suggests there's an issue with Python encodings, which is typically caused by a corrupted Python environment or incorrect PYTHONPATH settings. The steps above should help resolve the issue by creating a fresh Poetry installation and environment.

If you continue to have issues, you might want to check your Python installation:

```bash
which python3
python3 --version
```

Let me know if you need any clarification or if you're still experiencing issues after trying these steps.
