## Fixing Python Import Error (2025. 1. 25. 오후 7:11:46)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Unable to import 'clay_ai.agents.base'
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

_**Assistant**_

Let me check the folder structure first.

Since I don't see the folder structure provided, it seems the imports are looking for a package `clay_ai` that doesn't exist in the project. We need to adjust the imports to match the local project structure.

Here's the fix:

```python:agents/observer.py
// ... existing code ...
from agents.base import BaseAgent
from models.agents import AgentConfig, AgentStatus
from models.tasks import Task, TaskResult, TaskType
// ... existing code ...
```

The fix removes the `clay_ai.` prefix from the imports since the modules appear to be in the local project structure rather than an installed package. Make sure you have the corresponding files:
- `agents/base.py`
-
