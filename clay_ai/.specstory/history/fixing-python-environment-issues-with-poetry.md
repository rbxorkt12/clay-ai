It seems you're encountering a Python environment conflict issue when trying to use Poetry. The error suggests there's a problem with Python paths and environment settings. Let's fix this by following these steps:

1. First, let's clean up your Python environment:

```bash
# Remove existing Poetry environment
poetry env remove python

# Clear Poetry cache
poetry cache clear . --all
```

2. Make sure you have a clean Python installation. I recommend using pyenv to manage Python versions:

```bash
# Install pyenv if you haven't already (on macOS)
brew install pyenv

# Install Python 3.9 (as specified in your pyproject.toml)
pyenv install 3.9.18

# Set it as your local Python version
pyenv local 3.9.18
```

3. Update your pyproject.toml to be more specific about the Python version:

```toml:pyproject.toml
[tool.poetry]
# ... existing code ...

[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = ">=3.9,<3.10"  # This ensures Python 3.9.
